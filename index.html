                The exact date for our next event will be confirmed shortly but will be during the last week of April. We
                have two speakers lined up. The first of which is our resident docker guru and favorite opinionated engineer: Tim Haak. Details below.

                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>
                    Have you been wondering how to deploy your code to the internet yourself without having to pay for things like Laravel Forge?<br>
                    Well, then this talk is for you.<br>
                    I’ll be covering different stages of learning how to deploy your code.<br>
                    Starting how to start simply not knowing anything.<br>
                    Progressing through automating the initial steps.<br>
                    Finally covering how to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.<br>
                    I’ll cover the Pros and Cons of the different stages, and hopefully, covering the path you’ll need to go from not knowing anything to eventually mastering deployment.<br>
                    The talk will be more high level but a git repository with code for each step will be given during the talk.<br>
