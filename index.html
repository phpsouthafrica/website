                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>
                    Building an API is easy, working with someone else’s API is hard.<br>
                    Following the JSON:API specification helps build standardized APIs and makes automatic documentation easier. As https://jsonapi.org/ says, “If you’ve ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON:API can be your anti-bikeshedding tool.”<br>
                    This talk shows how to build APIs following the JSON:API spec in Laravel, Symfony, and Drupal. Each platform has its benefits, tradeoffs, and frustrations. I’m especially interested in considering tests, productionizing, and continuous integration when evaluating each platform.<br>
                    Spoiler: there’s no right choice! (You should probably be writing TypeScript-based lambda functions anyway...).<br>
                    Along the way I’ll give my opinionated take on what I like and don’t like about each platform. I’ll also introduce the context in which I recently evaluated these platforms: a multi-tenanted CMS site with a decoupled admin backend.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Speaker</h4>
                <p>
                    Roger is a web developer and CTO at How Might We, a Cape Town-based usability consultancy (human-centered design FTW!).<br>
                    He started out as a PHP developer with Drupal 4.6.2 (yes, that’s old) until Drupal 7, then it hurt his head too much and he switched to frontend frameworks and pretended he’d never heard of PHP. After a deep dive into Vue and testing, he discovered Laravel which restored some of the joy of server-side coding. <br>
                    Then he discovered Symfony and realised that it’s possible to code entities with typed properties (hey Tyler, why use arrays and strings for everything?).<br>
                    He is currently studying a post-graduate diploma in complexity theory and sustainability at Stellenbosch University and the Sustainability Institute, thanks to the helpfulness of the Cynefin Framework.

                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Have you been wondering how to deploy your code to the internet yourself without having to pay for things like Laravel Forge?<br>
                    Well, then this talk is for you.<br>
                    I’ll be covering different stages of learning how to deploy your code.<br>
                    Starting how to start simply not knowing anything.<br>
                    Progressing through automating the initial steps.<br>
                    Finally covering how to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.<br>
                    I’ll cover the Pros and Cons of the different stages, and hopefully, covering the path you’ll need to go from not knowing anything to eventually mastering deployment.<br>
                    The talk will be more high level but a git repository with code for each step will be given during the talk.<br>
